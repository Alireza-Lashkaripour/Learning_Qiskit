Hello @

I hope you are doing well. 

I read the paper you sent and tried to undersntadn it. Using the method proposed in that paper I formed wave-fucntion with 3 site and 2 bond dims, then continuing the appers method, generlized it into higher number of sites, dimes and layer (slides 3 and 4). Then, studied the MPS structre in MPS and in general "Block-Sparse Tensors"(slide 5 in report). At the end usd the classical MPS from pyblock3 and with same method in the paper mapped it into quantum ciruit and measured densitry matrix which the final energy was almost identical. (last slide)
